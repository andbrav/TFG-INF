# TFG-INF
This code was done for the completion of my computer science bachelor degree final project.
The project consisted in a revision of dimension reduction methods. A subset of dimension reduction methods were evaluated with different quantitative measures over the MNIST
dataset and afterwards the impact of this method was evaluated in the MNIST classification task for different classifiers.

The Data folder contains the datasets used. This are the MNIST dataset and two different subsets of this same dataset.
The DR folder contains the code used for the two experiments and the results in csv format.
The Figuras folder contains the plots and the code used to generate the plots shown in the project
